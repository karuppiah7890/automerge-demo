CRDT - Conflict-free Replicated Data Type

Area - Real Time Collaboration. 

Real Time Collaboration in documents - by multiple people - starting with two
people.

Two people are simulateneously working on a document, so, how does that look like?
How do you implement a mobile app, or web app or anything, where two users
on two different devices on different or same networks be able to Collaborate?
And also support offline usage.

network?
where is the document stored? in case of offline usage, so, we cannot store
in some central server? centralized systems

CRDT - Conflict-free Replicated Data Type

Conflict-free ?
Replicated?
Data type?

storing data - structure, type ? we are defining a new type, which has some
features

Conflict free - concurrent / simulateneous modification of data by multiple 
users - if there's any conflict in data - similar to git merge conflict - it
has to be resolved and we are looking at an automatic / manual resolution

----

User 1 ->

"Hello!"

User 2 ->

"Hello! Hi!"

User 3 (simulateneously when user 2 is typing) ->

"Hello! Hey! Hi"

action -> send to server and then reflect it in the view. not gonna work here -
it's going to very slow. when user makes changes in their doc in their local,
we immediately apply the changes in their local doc. We later merge all the
contents of each user's doc - to reach the collaborated doc's content

how to store?

automerge

JSON data structure

Replicated -? the data is replicated among all the nodes / peers / users. In 
this case, it's the document that the users are modifying, which is stored in
their local while modifying, but later merged to get final content.

git commit - git push - git pull - resolve merge conflicts and finally - we 
all have the same set of commits and same final state - same codebase.

here in the case of document collaboration - we want the final doc to be the
same in all the devices so that the users see the same thing - even after the
merge.
